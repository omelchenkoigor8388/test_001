        <h3>About</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The postpartum uterine cavity is different in size and shape than a non-pregnant uterus. This requires special instrumentation to manipulate the uterus during postpartum surgeries. This invention allows maneuvering the uterus for surgeries like postpartum tubal sterilization. The device is introduced into the uterine cavity and the tip is spread open by pushing forward the thumb piece located on the handle. A ratchet mechanism holds the thumb piece in place. Spring in the ratchet housing can provide for faster retraction of the thumb piece and removal of the device. The tip, when opened, conforms to the natural shape of the uterine cavity for maximum torque needed to efficiently manipulate the postpartum uterus. The tip, when opened, also prevents accidental slippage and removal of the device during the procedure. The uterus can be manipulated anteriorly/posteriorly and side ways using the handle. This brings the fundus close to the anterior abdominal wall allowing better visualizationof the fallopian tube. This also brings the fallopian tube within easy reach of the surgeon through the mini incision on the abdominal wall. The device also allows tilting the uterus left and right to better visualize each tube and easy to operate on.
            <br>
            The device also provides protection against accidental retraction or laceration of the tube and the surrounding tissue by stabilizing the uterus. This device not only makes it easier to perform the operation but also decreases the risks of complications. This device also decreases the operating time reducing the cost of the procedure.
            <br>
            The device can be disposable or non-disposable made of plastic, steel or any other suitable material. The device can also be used during postpartum laparoscopic procedures and other surgeries on a non-postpartum uterus as needed.
            <br>
            Postpartum tubal sterilization is difficult to perform under regional anesthesia due to the lack of muscle relaxation and difficulty localizing the fallopian tubes. This device allows for easier postpartum tubal sterilization under regional anesthesia.
            <br>
            Better control over the operating site using the device allows for smaller incision, consequently less bleeding, less postoperative pain and faster recovery.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Postpartum tubal sterilization is a permanent method of birth control in which a portion of the fallopian tube is interrupted and either tied, cut, clipped, blocked, cauterized or removed after birth. Tubal sterilization is the most commonly used method of birth control. Tubal sterilization is a highly effective method for women choosing to permanently terminate their reproductive ability.
            <br>
            The anatomy of a postpartum uterus is different than the uterus before pregnancy. The uterus goes through very significant anatomical and physiological changes to support the pregnancy. A postpartum uterus is bulkier, heavier, wider and longer. Consequently the traditional surgical instruments are not able to perform adequately as they are not designed to accommodate these anatomical changes in the uterus.
            <br>
            Several devices for uterine manipulation are currently used. These devices are not adequate for use on a postpartum uterus as they are designed for use on a prepregnant uterus and do not address the postpartum anatomical changes.
